# Red-Light-Green-Light
The goal of this project was to create a game that would act as a simulator for the popular
Korean series Squid Gamesâ€™ first game: Red Light Green Light. The game is basically made of
a player trying to reach a flag but the player cannot move when the light is red if the player does
that they lose a life. The player has a total of three lives and is supposed to reach the flag within
these three lives.
