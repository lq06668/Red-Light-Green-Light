# Red-Light-Green-Light
The goal of this project was to create a game that would act as a simulator for the popular
Korean series Squid Games’ first game: Red Light Green Light. The game is basically made of
a player trying to reach a flag but the player cannot move when the light is red if the player does
that they lose a life. The player has a total of three lives and is supposed to reach the flag within
these three lives. 

Three blocks—the input block, the control block, and the output block—were created as part of our strategy for the game. 
The input block consists of inputs from the keyboard and the clock dividers. The control block, consists of all the FSMs handling lives and switching screens, whilst the output block is made up of the pixel generator and the player's shifting positions.
